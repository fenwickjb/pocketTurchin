# pocketTurchin
The latest commit on the Master Branch is the most up to date version of the Pocket Turchin project.  
The features that I would consider to be cool on this project are the ViewPager, the data persistance despite the app being closed 
and reopened, the small database storing the value of "favorite" and the RecyclerView that intelligently keeps data loaded
to speed loading times but not burn through RAM.  I was also happy with the how the UI turned out because usually
I am not the best at doing User Interfaces designs since I prefer a more logical interface rather than a visually pleasing 
interface but I think that this projects UI is one of the best UI elements I have made so far in my CS studies.
